        <p id="below">These are the various changes that were made to the site over the past few weeks.</p>
        <p id="below">You may notice that some of the ideas others tudents gave were adopted and integrated into my site for general improvement purposes. To all of you that gave your ideas in class, I thank you.</p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li>For the first and third weeks, I added a PDF viewer so people can easily get a preview of the items that was available for download on those pages respectively.</li>
            <li>Over the weeks, many changes were made to the fourth week's web page as called for by the instructor, including changing the color of the links, Resizing the first letter of certain paragraphs, and other miscellaneous formatting.</li>
            <li>Images were added and formatted to fit perfectly into week four's page.</li>
            <li>All pages were redesigned to be responsive so as to allow for better viewing on any sized screen.</li>
            <li>All folders were cleaned up and given futureproof titles and such.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="below">Thank you again for all the help, fellow classmates. Your help was greatly appreciated!</p>
