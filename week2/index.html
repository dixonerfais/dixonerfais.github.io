        <p>Hey there. My name is, as you may know, Tyler Dickerson, or Charlse in some cases. I enjoy PC gaming, mainly Minecraft and other small indie games, longboarding, and visiting YouTube and other miscellaneous sites that contain entertaining videos.</p>
        <p>I currently work part-time at Safeway as a courtesy clerk, rolling in an average of a <em topper="This is all the money I make in a week.">whopping $125/<strong>week</strong></em>. Before your pants hit the ground, allow me to lend you a belt of reassurance. I do attend West Valley College, where I will complete my general education and then transfer to San Jose State University, where I plan on majoring in comnputer science.</p>
        <p>Perhaps some day in the future I will work for Google as a software engineer, but that's a story for another day. As for now, my name is Tyler, and in case you were curious, the bread is down aisle fifteen.</p>
